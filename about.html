                    Before diving into your first lesson, think about why you want to code in the first place.

                    This will help you determine which programming language you decide to learn first, what sorts of
                    projects you want to complete, and ultimately what you want to make of your skills.

                    Here are some well-known benefits:</p>

                    Let’s get the obvious out of the way. Knowledge of computer programming is a valuable employment
                    asset.

                    As technology continues to weave into our daily lives, coding skills will become more desired among
                    candidates — according to job board Indeed.com, several of the most in-demand skills fall under
                    computing.

                    If you’re looking to make a career pivot into tech or to switch to a more technical role within your
                    field, knowing at least one relevant programming language is a must.

                    This doesn’t just apply to developers, though. Web designers should know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    Project managers should know the inner workings of the tools they help craft.</p>

                    The average entry-level salary in the U.S. is $40,153 in 2022. But the average starting salary for a
                    programmer is more than twice as much, at $85,293.

                    We mentioned earlier that there are differences between coders and programmers. As you continue to
                    learn about coding, you may start to specialize. Many of the highest coding salaries come from the
                    ability to offer your skills in a specific type of coding.

                    For example, as you continue to code, you may decide to become a developer. Besides writing code,
                    developers also debug software and work with source code. Developers usually specialize in a
                    specific programming language.

                    Developers often earn higher salaries than programmers and have high projected job growth. According
                    to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs for developers should grow by 22% by 2030.
